cupid - The incomplete messaging app for Nihilist, yes it's exhausting.
=====

Please help make cupid whole again:

1. Add a single view/controller to display some gui components so people can interact with the app.  It should be able to
display a list of inbound messages and also allow a user to send an outbound message.  It can be as fancy or as ugly as you
want.

2. When a user send a message from whatever ui you created in step #1 the implementation should then mock a response after
a short delay.  So if you send a message to Bob, pretend Bob sends you back a message after some short time period
(hint: schedule something and use the delgates provided)

3. How can you persist the messages and/or users to disk in the event the app is restarted?

4.
